Enclosed is the windows build of Shell Scapes, a video of the Android demo, and the apk file for the Android version. 
The windows version can be played with a mouse, touch pad, or touch screen computer. 
There is an error shown in the video of the Android demo where the paintings on the shells in the Gallery do not load correctly, otherwise the game is fully functional.
